Extra data and tools for WordNet 3.1 and WordNet Bahasa (wn-msa) in several formats.

== WordNet Core

Core refers to the percentage of synsets covered from the semi-automatically compiled list of 5000 "core"
word senses in Princeton WordNet (approximately the 5000 most frequently used word senses).
They are marked with âœª in the interface.
The original list is here from http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/standoff-files/core-wordnet.txt (Boyd-Graber et al., 2008).
[Open Multilingual WordNet's version](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/wn30-core-synsets.tab) (converted to wn30 synsets).

This converts them to WordNet 3.1 synsets, available in tab and TURTLE formats:

1. `wn31-core-synsets.tab`
2. `wn31-core-synsets.ttl`

== wordnet-tools
